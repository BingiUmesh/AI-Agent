# AI-Agent

This repository houses an AI agent project, featuring a web-based interface for interaction alongside its core logic implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. It provides a foundational structure for developing and deploying simple AI agents that can be accessed and controlled through a browser.

## Description

The "AI-Agent" project aims to demonstrate a basic AI agent setup. It integrates a Python-based agent (developed in a Jupyter Notebook) with a straightforward web frontend built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, served by a Node.js backend. This allows for easy experimentation and interaction with the agent's capabilities via a web browser. `tools.js` likely contains utility functions or definitions for functionalities the agent can use or expose.

## Features

-   **Interactive Web Interface**: A simple web application (`index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`) to interact with the AI agent.
-   **Core AI Agent Logic**: Implementation of a basic AI agent within a Jupyter Notebook (`My_Simple_agent.ipynb`) for ease of development and iteration.
-   **Node.js Backend**: A server (`app.js`) to host the web application and potentially mediate communication with the AI agent.
-   **Utility Tools**: A `tools.js` file providing helper functions or definitions that can be utilized by the web application or integrated into the agent's workflow.

## Files Overview

-   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
-   `My_Simple_agent.ipynb`: The primary Jupyter Notebook containing the AI agent's logic and implementation in Python.
-   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
-   `app.js`: The Node.js server application responsible for serving the web interface and potentially handling API requests.
-   `index.html`: The main HTML file for the web-based user interface.
-   `package-lock.json`: Records the exact dependency tree for Node.js packages.
-   `package.json`: Defines project metadata and lists Node.js dependencies.
-   `style.css`: Stylesheets for the `index.html` web interface.
-   `tools.js`: A JavaScript file likely containing utility functions, definitions, or an API for the agent's capabilities, to be used by `app.js` or directly by the frontend.

## Installation

To set up and run this project, you will need to install both Python (with Jupyter) and Node.js.

### Prerequisites

-   **Python 3.x**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
-   **Node.js & npm**: Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Step-by-Step Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Agent.git
    cd AI-Agent
    ```

2.  **Install Python Dependencies (for the AI Agent Notebook)**:
    While `requirements.txt` is not provided, you will likely need `jupyter` and other AI-related libraries (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `openai` if using an API).

    It is recommended to create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
    Then, install Jupyter and any other necessary packages:
    ```bash
    pip install jupyter
    # Example for other common AI libraries:
    # pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
    # pip install openai  # If the agent uses OpenAI's API
    ```

3.  **Install Node.js Dependencies (for the Web Application)**:
    Navigate to the project root and install the Node.js packages defined in `package.json`:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

### 1. Start the AI Agent Notebook

To run and interact with the core AI agent logic:

```bash
# Ensure your Python virtual environment is active if you created one
jupyter notebook My_Simple_agent.ipynb
```
This will open Jupyter in your browser, where you can run the cells in `My_Simple_agent.ipynb` to understand and execute the agent's logic. If the agent is designed to be an API endpoint, it might need to be run separately or integrated into `app.js`.

### 2. Start the Web Application

To launch the web interface:

```bash
npm start
```
Alternatively, if `package.json` doesn't define a `start` script, you can run:
```bash
node app.js
```

The web application will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port specified in `app.js`). Open this URL in your web browser to interact with the frontend.

**Note**: The exact integration between `My_Simple_agent.ipynb` (Python) and `app.js` (Node.js) is not explicitly defined by the file list. Depending on the project's design, `app.js` might call a Python script, interact with a separate Python Flask/FastAPI server, or `My_Simple_agent.ipynb` might be purely for development/testing, with a JavaScript-based agent logic in `app.js` and `tools.js`. For a simple setup, the agent's logic might be manually run in Jupyter, and `app.js` could provide a simple UI or mock responses.
