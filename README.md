## Description

The **AI-Agent** project is a proof-of-concept demonstrating how a simple AI agent can be exposed through a clean, user-friendly web interface. The core logic and experimentation for the agent are contained within a Jupyter Notebook (`My_Simple_agent.ipynb`), while the interactive front-end is built with standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).

This setup allows for rapid prototyping of agent capabilities in Python and provides a ready-to-use application for demonstration and user interaction.

## Features ‚ú®

-   **Interactive Web UI:** A simple and intuitive chat-like interface to communicate with the AI agent.
-   **Core Agent Logic:** A Jupyter Notebook detailing the implementation of the simple AI agent.
-   **Client-Side Logic:** All front-end interactions are handled client-side, making it lightweight and easy to deploy.
-   **Extensible Tools:** The `tools.js` file is structured to allow for easy addition of new capabilities or "tools" for the agent.

## Installation üîß

To run this project locally, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Agent.git
    cd AI-Agent
    ```

2.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**
    The `package.json` file indicates there might be development dependencies (e.g., a simple server like `live-server`). Run the following command to install them:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **(Optional) Set up Python Environment for the Notebook:**
    To explore and run the Jupyter Notebook, it's recommended to create a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate it (on Windows)
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # Or (on macOS/Linux)
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Install necessary libraries
    pip install jupyterlab numpy pandas # Add other required libraries here
    ```

## Usage üöÄ

There are two main components to this project: the web application and the Python notebook.

### Running the Web Application

You can open the web interface by simply opening the `index.html` file in your browser.

For a better experience, you can use a simple local server. If you have a package like `live-server` installed via `npm`, you can run:

```bash
npx live-server
```

This will start a local development server and automatically open `index.html` in your default web browser.

### Exploring the Jupyter Notebook

1.  Make sure your Python virtual environment is activated.
2.  Start the Jupyter server:
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3.  Your browser will open a new tab with the Jupyter interface. Navigate to and open `My_Simple_agent.ipynb` to view and run the agent's core logic.
