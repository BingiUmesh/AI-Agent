A simple, interactive AI agent built with Node.js and a web-based user interface.

---

## 📖 Description

This repository contains the source code for a simple AI agent designed to be interacted with through a clean web interface. The core application is built with Node.js, serving a vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend.

The project also includes a Jupyter Notebook (`My_Simple_agent.ipynb`), which was used for the initial exploration, prototyping, and demonstration of the agent's core logic in Python.

### Features
*   **Interactive Web UI:** A simple and intuitive interface to interact with the agent.
*   **Node.js Backend:** A lightweight server (`app.js`) to handle requests and serve the application.
*   **Modular Tools:** Agent capabilities can be extended via helper functions (as seen in `tools.js`).
*   **Prototyping Notebook:** A clear Python-based exploration of the agent's concepts is included.

## ⚙️ Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following software installed on your machine:
*   [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v16 or higher recommended)
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
*   [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) (for running the `.ipynb` file)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Agent.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd AI-Agent
    ```

3.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## 🚀 Usage

### Running the Web Application

1.  **Start the server:**
    ```sh
    node app.js
    ```

2.  **Open your browser:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in `app.js`).

You should now see the web interface where you can interact with the AI agent.

### Exploring the Jupyter Notebook

The notebook contains the Python-based logic and experiments for the agent.

1.  **Start the Jupyter server:**
    Make sure you are in the project's root directory and run:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2.  **Open the notebook:**
    Your browser will open a new tab with the Jupyter interface. Click on `My_Simple_agent.ipynb` to view and run the notebook.
